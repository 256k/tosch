finger sensitive device that communicates finger on / off and amount of contact over osc

8(or 4?) pcb touch sensitive pads like the microfreak and make noise control 

(crazy idea, have a haptic motor inside to simulate click anad have it communicate independently through osc)

send on off for finger touch and s for surface touched. (0 1024?) depends on how those pads are made i have no clue.


MVP: make a 4 patch piece with just on/off and surface contact  over midi under afterpressure cc  or something...
